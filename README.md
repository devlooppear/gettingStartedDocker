# Getting started

This repository is a sample application for users following the getting started guide at https://docs.docker.com/get-started/.

The application is based on the application from the getting started tutorial at https://github.com/docker/getting-started.

## Hi, now it's me. LOL

I made this using the Docker documentation. I'm trying to improve my Docker skills. I've created a `docker-compose.yml` file here. If you want, you can run the container to see the application running using docker compose up. To stop the Docker container, use docker compose down. I hope this is cool for people who enjoy looking at containers working, and also for me to check sometimes when I'm using containers. Docker is a powerful tool and very important to learn.
